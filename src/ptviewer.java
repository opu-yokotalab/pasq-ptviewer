/*
 * PTViewer 2.8
 * 
 * Based on version 2.5 by Helmut Dersch
 * Modified by Fulvio Senore (fsenore@ica-net.it)
 * 
 * Version 2.7L2:
 *  beta1 
 *   added parameter value quality=4 to activate Lanczos2 interpolator
 *   speeded up panning (bilinear only)
 *   fixed: the mouse cursor did not change to HAND when over a hotspot and using the Sun VM
 *   fixed: pressing the spacebar did not show hotspots until the pano was dragged
 *   fixed: a custom mouse cursor did not show up until the mouse was moved
 *  beta2
 *   now when panning very slowly the image does not move in strange ways any more
 *  beta3
 *   panning and zooming with the keyboard now uses bilinear instead of Lanczos2 
 *     so it's faster (thanks to Vladimir Simunic)
 *   now if using the Sun VM V1.4 or later ptviewer draws the panorama frames using
 *     hardware accelerated graphics. On Windows it is now faster than with the Microsoft VM
 *  beta4
 *   added new parameter "dynLoadROIs" (=true) to dynamically load a panorama sliced as ROIs
 *     depending on the current view direction 
 *   fixed: when diplaying a wait image with the Sun VM the background of the applet
 *     was not set to the background colour
 *   modified ptzoom.java in order to make it work with quality==4. At the moment the image is
 *     rendered with bilinear interpolation only
 *   added new parameter "hsEnableVisibleOnly" (default false). If set to true hotspots
 *     will be disabled is not visible
 *  beta5
 *   fixed: with the beta4 version, under certain circumstances, text hotspots did not
 *     use the bgcolor setting  
 *   small speedup in ptImageTo2DArray()
 *   added new parameter showToolbar (default false) if true shows an integrated toolbar
 *   added new parameter imgLoadFeedbak (default true): if set to false ptviewer will
 *     not give feedback of the image loading progress
 *   added new parameter toolbarImage: name of the image used to draw the toolbar
 *     default: Toolbar.gif file contained in the jar file
 *  beta6
 *    fixed: if the panorama was not fully spherical hotspots were displayed at a
 *      wrong y coordinate
 *    fixed: the toolbar sometimes incorrectly showed an OVER button when leaving the
 *      applet passing over a button. Now the toolbar handles also the mouseExit event 
 *    fixed: the toolbad did not update the HS button when using the 
 *      ptviewer.showHS() and ptviewer.hideHS() methods
 *    added a flag to avoid a lot of unnecessary paint()s while dynLoading ROIs
 *      now loading is much faster
 *    fixed: with some computers the zoom buttons did not work properly because
 *      ptviewer.paint() did not execute
 *    added a limit to maximum zoom speed with the toolbar to avoid too fast panning 
 *      with very fast computers
 *  beta7
 *    fixed: the previous fix to avoid unnecessary paint()s made it impossible to pan
 *      while dynLoading the pano
 *    fixed: calling moveTo() or gotoView() from a link while dynLoading ROIs caused
 *      ptviewer to keep panning until you clicked with the mouse. Now these functions 
 *      are disabled while dynLoading
 *    modified the gotoView(): now if the requested fov is too large to fit in the current
 *      pano, it is reduced. In previous versions this caused the function to do nothing.
 *      this function was also called by moveTo(), that had the same problem
 *    if the tilt parameters requests an impossible direction of view (outside the pano)
 *      now the the tilt angle is set to the maximum or minimum possible value. previous versions
 *      set it to 0
 *    if using the toolbar the hotspot's description is also written to the toolbar when
 *      the mouse moves over the hotspot
 *      previous versions only wrote it to the browser's status bar
 *    fixed bug: the viewer crashed if the parameters 
 *      specified a wait image and the integrated toolbar
 *  beta8
 *    added new parameter "autoTime". Used with the auto parameter, it sets the time in seconds
 *      for a full 360 degrees pano revolution
 *    added public method startAutoPan( pan_inc,  tilt_inc, zoom, autoTime ): the last
 *      parameter works like the autoTime applet parameter
 *    now the toolbar is painted before static hotspots, 
 *      so it is possible to draw shotspots over the toolbar
 *    added new parameter "toolbarDescr_x" to set the x coordinate (in pixels) of the
 *      hotspots description in the toolbar
 *    added new paramater "toolbarText_color" to set the color of the hotspots description 
 *      in the toolbar. The default is black. This value is overridden by the "c" parameter
 *      in the hotspot's definition (if any) 
 *    modified the PTViewerScript() function: now the last command can end with a ";"
 *      without causing an exception
 * 
 *
 * Version 2.7.1L2:
 * 
 *  beta1
 *    added new parameter "shsEnableVisibleOnly" (default false). If set to true static hotspots
 *      will be disabled is not visible
 *    fixed: when loading new panos with newPanoFromList() the toolbar did reset its
 *      properties (text color and position) to the default. Now it keeps the values
 *      set with <param> tags.
 *    fixed: when loading new panos with newPanoFromList() from a hotspot the hotspot
 *      button of the toolbar went out of sync
 *    fixed: when using the toolbar and the parameter "view_height" the toolbar moved up
 *      each time that a pano was loaded with newPanoFromList()
 *    changed: now the tiltmax parameter accepts negative values and the tiltmin parameter
 *      accepts positive ones (hard to believe, but somebody asked for it!)
 *    added two public methods: getPanoIsLoaded() and getFilename()
 * 
 *  beta2
 *    modified scaleImage() to avoid image shift wit some image sizes
 *    added parameter "popup_panning", originally added by David Buxo to his version of PTViewer
 *    Tore Meyer (Tore.Meyer@gmx.de) added optional parameter "autoTime" to moveTo() and moveFromTo() 
 * 
 * Version 2.8:
 * 
 *  beta1
 *    modified the values for the "quality" parameter:
 *      now 4 means nearest neighbour when panning, lanczos2 when steady,
 *          5 means bilinear when panning, lanczos2 when steady.
 *          6 means nn if panning fast, bil if panning slowly, lanczos2 if steady
 *      the new default is 6
 *    modified math_transform to optimize also nn interpolation
 *    rewritten math_transform() to enable interpolation of the geometric transform
 *      between lines. Now the transform is computed using longs instead of ints to
 *      achieve more resolution: zooming in a lot and panning slowly does not cause strange
 *      movements anymore
 *    Rik Littlefield (rj.littlefield@computer.org) has rewritten the image loading code:
 *      now it is much faster, expecially with larger images
 *      As a consequence the "maxarray" is no longer used by the applet. Using maxarray 
 *      will not cause errors, but it will not be used.
 * 
 *   beta2
 *    now dynamic loading of ROIs is faster. This is more visible once the images are
 *      cached in the local computer. No more drawing on invisible ROIs, drawing uses bilinear
 *      to be faster.
 *    fixed bug: when using nn interpolator and a rectangular hotspot the hotspot was not
 *      painted correctly while panning
 *    added new parameter "mouseSensitivity", it is a decimal number, default = 1
 *      if mouseSensitivity < 1 panning will be slower
 *      if mouseSensitivity > 1 panning will be faster
 *    added new parameter "mouseQ6Threshold" used only if quality=6. It is a decimal number, default = 1
 *      mouseQ6Threshold > 1 will require a larger mouse movement to switch from bilinear to nn
 *      mouseQ6Threshold < 1 will require a smaller mouse movement to switch from bilinear to nn
 *    fixed: when loading a pano that was not tall enough to fit in the current window
 *      with the current fov ptviewer reduced too much the fov value.
 *      Now that vale is reduced to the correct value that will no require vertical panning
 * 
 *   beta3
 *    added support for *.ptv and *.ptvref custom files
 * 
 *   beta4
 *    added new parameter "outOfMemoryURL": it is a link to a page to be opened in case of 
 *      out of memory error while loading the pano 
 *    some web servers (like IIS 6) by default do not serve files with unknown extensions, but they
 *      send a "file not found". To bypass this problem .ptv and .ptvref files can be renamed as follows:
 *        pano.ptvref ==> pano.ptvref.txt
 *        pano.ptv ==> pano.ptv.jpg
 *      the trailing extension does not need to be "txt" or "jpg" but they can be any
 *      extension known by the server
 *    added parameter "mousePanTime" used to limit the maximum speed when panning with
 *      the mouse. It works like "autoTime": it is the minimum time (in seconds) needed for a full
 *      360 degrees revolution
 *    fixed: the applet did not load images (like a wait screen) if they were packed in the jar file
 *  
 *   beta5
 *    Rober Bisland (R.Bilsland@Dial.pipex.com) added a new Javascript command, DrawSHSPopup(), 
 *      and new functionality that allows multiple static hotspots to be drawn, hidden and popped up at once.
 *    he also added a new parameter: "shsStopAutoPanOnClick" (default true). If set to false clicking 
 *      on a static hotspot will not stop an AutoPan.
 *    added support for encrypted .ptv files.
 *    Ercan Gigi (ercan.gigi@philips.com) added the "autoNumTurns" parameter which is used 
 *      to limit the number of full 360 degree turns when auto-panning is on.
 * 
 * 	 beta6
 *    changed the encryption keys format from String to byte[] to avoid problems with Mac
 *      and Linux when some bytes have negative values.
 *    now the "Y" key can be used to zoom out, like the "Z" key. This helps with some
 *      keyboard layouts (Germany).
 *    fixed: if an encrypted .ptv file contained a tile smaller than 2000 bytes it
 *      caused the viewer to crash.
 * 
 *   beta7
 *    fixed: when autopanning and quality=6 moving the mouse over the viewer caused
 *      the interpolator to switch to nearest neighbour reducing image quality
 *    added new parameter "horizonPosition" to specify the position of the horizon
 *      if it is not in the middle of the pano image
 *    pressing "o" will interactively decrease the value of the horizonPosition parameter
 *      with feedback in the status bar, pressong "O" will increase it. This is useful to quickly
 *      find the correct value for the parameter. Note that after pressing the key you will 
 *      have to pan in order to see the effect. Hotspots position will not be updated since
 *      it would require more work and this feature is not intended for production use.
 *    added paramether "authoringMode" (default = false). If set to true it will enable 
 *      authoring features that could have unexpected results for end users
 *      at the moment it will enable the "o" key. 
 *    added parameter "toolbarBoldText", default false. If set to true the hotspots description
 *      in the toolber will be written in bold
 *    added parameter "statusMessage": it can be used to specify a fixed text to be written
 *      in the status bar. The text is written everytime the user drags the mouse or presses an arrow key
 *      this parameter does not work with Firefox (for security reasons)
 *    added parameter "hsShowDescrInStatusBar" (default = true). If set to false 
 *      the applet will not show the hotspots' description in the browser's status
 *      bar when the mouse moves over a hotspot
 *    changed default mouse sensitivity because panning was too fast with modern computers
 * 	  added new features in static hotspots declaration: 
 *      "y" and "b" values can be negative: if negative they are computed from the bottom 
 *      of the viewer window and not from the top
 *      "x" and "a" values can be negative: if negative they are computed from the right 
 *      of the viewer window and not from the left
 *      "x" must compute to a positive number lower than "a"
 *      "y" must compute to a positive number lower than "b"
 * 
 *   beta8
 *    fixed: when using param "pano0" and so on, the handling of parameters between
 *      "{" and "}" was case sensitive while normal parameters processing was
 *      NOT case sensitive. Now this handling is case insensitive too.
 *    changed: in .ptv files handling, references to the web address hosting the image
 *      (used to decrypt an encrypted image)
 *      were done using getCodeBase(). Now they are done using getDocumentBase() so
 *      it should not be possible to create a page on a server that shows a file from
 *      a second server using the copy of ptviewer stored in the second server
 *      (image stealing).
